# Appi skeleton for Grav CMS

![Appi skeleton screenshot](screenshot.jpg)

Appi skeleton is based on [Appi theme](https://github.com/tranduyhung/grav-theme-appi) which is a port of [Appi HTML template](http://blacktie.co/2015/08/appi-app-landing-page/) by [Black Tie](http://blacktie.co/)

# Installation

## New Grav site

1. Download the latest release in this repository.
2. Unzip the package into your web root folder.
3. Access your site via web browser.

## Existing Grav site

You can just install [Appi theme](https://github.com/tranduyhung/grav-theme-appi), but page content will need to reference the Appi theme's supported templates. It is strongly advised to at least install the Appi skeleton package to see the theme's capabilities in action.

To install  **just** the theme:

```
$ bin/gpm install appi
```
