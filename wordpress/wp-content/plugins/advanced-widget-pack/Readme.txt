== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I change the default "No Image available" icon =

In the widget folder there is a folder called "images". Inside this folder you will find a 75px by 75px .png image called "nothumb.png".
Simply create your own .png image with the same name and dimensions and copy it to the images folder overwriting the original.
